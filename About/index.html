    <h1>About</h1> 
    
    <p>Hi I’m Maria! A software engineer based in 🇧🇷 and here is my diary on learning (not always) cutting-edge technology.</p>
<p>I started writing code when I was 13 and never stopped since then. During the past few years I worked for a few startups in Brazil and USA, even leading the  web for South Hemisphere’s then biggest car sharing startup.</p>
<p>I’m an avid learner and I always try to share what I learn through talks, some of them are available <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/clarasantana" target="_blank" rel="external">here</a> and <a href="https://pt.slideshare.net/MariaClaraSantana1" target="_blank" rel="external">here</a>. I also teach on workshops such as RailsGirls and DjangoGirls.</p>
